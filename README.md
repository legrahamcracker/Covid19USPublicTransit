# Analyzing the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Public Transit in Urban Areas across the United States

# Objective
The goal of this analysis is to provide a historical analysis of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on public transit and commuting behaviors within the top 20 urbanized areas across the United States. 

# Context
The COVID-19 pandemic saw a major change across the United States and the world of lockdown and social distancing. According to the [US Department of Health and Human Services](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/05/09/fact-sheet-end-of-the-covid-19-public-health-emergency.html), the US COVID-19 Public Health Emergency ended on May 11th, 2023. 

Because public transit has increased density of commuters compared to car travel, it was expected that ridership decreased during the pandemic. Here are some questions related to how the pandemic effected public transit across the US.

- How much did ridership decrease by? <br>
- Has ridership returned to normal? If not, how far are pre-pandemic ridership numbers is post-pandemic numbers? <br>
- How do urban areas compare across the United States in terms of returning to commuting patterns from pre-pandemic? <br>
- How has the advent of work from home changed commuting patterns?

According to the [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/urban-rural.html), “for the 2020 Census, an urban area will comprise  a densely settled core of census blocks that meet minimum housing unit density and/or population density requirements. This includes adjacent territory containing non-residential urban land uses. To qualify as an urban area, the territory identified according to criteria must encompass at least 2,000 housing units or have a population of at least 5,000.”

# Data Source

The first dataset is an adjusted monthly ridership information updated to August of 2023 with data through 2002. The source of the dataset is the Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) National Transit Database (NTD). The dataset can be found [here](https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/monthly-module-adjusted-data-release).

The second dataset include estimated data based on the US census on commuter means of transportation to work updated to 2022. The dataset covers commuter information from 2018 to 2022. The dataset can be found [here](https://data.census.gov/table/ACSST1Y2022.S0801?t=Commuting&g=010XX00US$4000000). 

The third dataset includes generic urban area statistics like population, land area, and housing units for 2020 urban areas. The source of the dataset is the US Census Bureau. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/urban-rural.html).

These datasets will allow for thorough exploration of public transit and commuting characteristics of the period before and during the pandemic. Information on ridership will showcase the affect of COVID-19 on transit while commuter mode share may showcase what modes increased in use when public transit decreased.
